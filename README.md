# working_custom_data_yolov8

This repos explains the custom object detection training using Yolov8

The goal is to detect a person is using mask or not and whether using it in wrong way. I am using "Face Mask Dataset" from kaggle which is already available in yolo format. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maalialharbi/face-mask-dataset?resource=download

I have referred https://github.com/Balakishan77/Yolov8-Custom-Object-Detetction/tree/main extensively for this. So all thanks to the person.

I have made some corrections to the file path and have also added an image to better understand the file structure that one needs to have in Google Drive.
I have also added the test file to be used (test-for-masks.mp4) and the resultant file after testing (test-for-masks(1).mp4)
